# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Distinct Tracks and Artists

```{r}
PLAYLIST_DF %>% distinct(track_id) %>% nrow()
PLAYLIST_DF %>% distinct(artist_id) %>% nrow()
```

## Most Popular Tracks

```{r}
PLAYLIST_DF %>% 
  group_by(track_name) %>% 
  summarise(appearances = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(appearances)) %>% 
  slice_head(n = 5)
```

## Most Danceable Track
SONGS %>% arrange(desc(danceability)) %>% slice(1)

# Playlist Curation

Based on anchor songs "One Dance" and "Closer", I explored related songs using playlist co-occurrence, musical features, artist connection, year similarity, and valence matching.

```{r}
ultimate_playlist <- tibble(
  track_order = 1:12,
  track_name = c(
    "Don't Let Me Down",
    "Cold Water",
    "Too Good",
    "Broccoli (feat. Lil Yachty)",
    "Work from Home",
    "Forever",
    "Roses",
    "Party In The U.S.A.",
    "See You Again",
    "Replay",
    "Paper Planes",
    "Soak Up The Sun"
  ),
  artist = c(
    "The Chainsmokers",
    "Major Lazer feat. Justin Bieber & MÃ˜",
    "Drake feat. Rihanna",
    "D.R.A.M. feat. Lil Yachty",
    "Fifth Harmony",
    "Chris Brown",
    "The Chainsmokers",
    "Miley Cyrus",
    "Wiz Khalifa",
    "Iyaz",
    "M.I.A.",
    "Sheryl Crow"
  )
)
```

# Playlist Feature Analysis

```{r}
# Enrich Playlist
final_playlist_features <- ultimate_playlist %>%
  left_join(SONGS %>% rename(track_name = name), by = "track_name") %>%
  distinct(track_name, .keep_all = TRUE)

# View playlist with features
final_playlist_features %>%
  select(track_order, track_name, artist, danceability, energy, valence)

```

## Danceability Flow

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(final_playlist_features, aes(x = track_order, y = danceability)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Danceability Flow of Ultimate Playlist",
    x = "Track Order",
    y = "Danceability"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Design Principles

This playlist was built around two anchor songs, "One Dance" and "Closer," emphasizing high danceability and smooth energetic flow. Related tracks were selected using heuristics based on co-appearance, key and tempo matching, artist similarity, release year consistency, and mood alignment. The playlist progresses from high-energy dance tracks through smoother R&B and pop, ending in a mellow, relaxed vibe for a full musical journey. Lesser-known tracks are included to encourage discovery along with familiarity.

# Conclusion

Through responsible data management, statistical analysis, musical feature engineering, and thoughtful curation, I created a playlist that balances hit songs and hidden gems in a way that flows naturally and keeps listeners engaged from start to finish.
