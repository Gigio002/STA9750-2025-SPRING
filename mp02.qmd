## Initial Analysis of SEP Data

I analyzed the EIA_SEP_REPORT dataset to explore U.S. state electricity
profiles, focusing on electricity costs, emissions, and environmental
efficiency.

### Most Expensive Retail Electricity

I identified the state with the highest retail electricity price.

Code:

``` r
EIA_SEP_REPORT |> arrange(desc(electricity_price_MWh)) |> slice(1) |> select(state, electricity_price_MWh) 
```

```{r}
EIA_SEP_REPORT |> arrange(desc(electricity_price_MWh)) |> slice(1) |> select(state, electricity_price_MWh) 
```

Answer: Hawaii (\$386 per MWh)

### Dirtiest Electricity Mix

I determined which state has the highest CO₂ emissions per MWh of
electricity generated.

Code:

``` r
EIA_SEP_REPORT |> arrange(desc(CO2_MWh)) |> slice(1) |> select(state, CO2_MWh, primary_source)
```

Answer: West Virginia (1,925 lbs CO₂ per MWh, primarily from coal)

### Average U.S. CO₂ Emissions per MWh

I computed the weighted average of CO₂ emissions across all states,
using the generation capacity as weights.

``` r
weighted_avg_CO2 <- sum(EIA_SEP_REPORT$CO2_MWh * EIA_SEP_REPORT$generation_MWh) / sum(EIA_SEP_REPORT$generation_MWh)
```

``` r
weighted_avg_CO2
```

Answer: 805.37 lbs CO₂ per MWh

### Rarest Primary Energy Source & Its Cost

I identified the least common primary energy source and where it is
used.

``` r
EIA_SEP_REPORT |> count(primary_source, sort = TRUE) |> slice_tail(n=1) 
```

Then, to find its associated cost and location:

``` r
EIA_SEP_REPORT |> filter(primary_source == "Petroleum") |> select(state, electricity_price_MWh)
```

Rarest Source: Petroleum

Used in: Hawaii

Electricity Cost: \$386 per MWh

### NY vs. Texas Energy Cleanliness

I compared New York’s CO₂ emissions with Texas', calculating how many
times cleaner NY’s energy is

``` r
NY_CO2 <- EIA_SEP_REPORT |>
    filter(state == "New York") |>
    pull(CO2_MWh)

TX_CO2 <- EIA_SEP_REPORT |>
    filter(state == "Texas") |>
    pull(CO2_MWh)

cleanliness_ratio <- TX_CO2 / NY_CO2
cleanliness_ratio
```

Answer: New York’s energy mix is 1.64 times cleaner than Texas’

## Public Transit Service Analysis

I analyzed public transit usage and trip lengths across different
agencies, cities, and states. Below is a summary of my findings along
with the R code used.

### Agency with the Highest Ridership (UPT)

Which transit agency has the highest number of unlinked passenger trips
(UPT)?

MTA New York City Transit

City: Brooklyn, NY

UPT: 2,632,003,044 (≈ 2.63 billion trips)

``` r
NTD_SERVICE |> 
    arrange(desc(UPT)) |> 
    select(Agency, City, State, UPT) |> 
    head(1)
```

### Average Trip Length for "MTA" Agencies

What is the average trip length (miles per UPT) for agencies containing
"MTA" in their name?

Average Trip Length: 4.56 miles

``` r
NTD_SERVICE |> filter(str_detect(Agency, "MTA")) |> summarize(Avg_Trip_Length = sum(MILES) / sum(UPT))
```

### Longest Average Trip Length in New York City

Which agency has the longest average trip length in New York City?

MTA Long Island Rail Road

City: New York

Average Trip Length: 24.3 miles

``` r
NTD_SERVICE |> filter(City %in% c("New York", "Brooklyn", "Staten Island")) |> mutate(Avg_Trip_Length = MILES / UPT) |> arrange(desc(Avg_Trip_Length)) |> select(Agency, City, Avg_Trip_Length) |> head(1)
```

### State with the Fewest Total Miles

Which state has the lowest total transit miles?

State: New Hampshire (NH)

Total Miles: 3,749,892 miles

``` r
NTD_SERVICE |> group_by(State) |> summarize(Total_Miles = sum(MILES)) |> arrange(Total_Miles) |> head(1)
```

### States Missing from the Data-set

Which U.S. states are missing from the dataset (i.e., have no transit
data)?

The following 18 states are missing:

AZ, AR, CA, CO, HI, IA, KS, LA, MO, MT, NE, NV, NM, ND, OK, SD, TX, UT,
WY

``` r
all_states <- state.abb # List of all state abbreviations missing_states <- setdiff(all_states, unique(NTD_SERVICE$State)) missing_states 
```

\# Shows states missing from the dataset

### Energy Efficiency Analysis

Goal:

-   Calculate Energy Efficiency for each transit mode (BTU per PMT).

-   Identify most and least energy-efficient modes.

Sample NTD_ENERGY dataset

``` r
NTD_ENERGY <- data.frame( Mode = c("Bus", "Rail", "Vanpool"), Diesel_Fuel = c(1000, 500, 200), # Gallons Gasoline = c(800, 300, 100) #Gallons Natural_Gas = c(600, 200, 50) # 1000 cubic feet )
```

BTU conversion factors

``` r
BTU_factors <- c( "Diesel_Fuel" = 138690, # BTU per gallon "Gasoline" = 120000, # BTU per gallon "Natural_Gas" = 1037000 # BTU per 1000 cubic feet )
```

Calculated total BTU for each fuel type and sum them

``` r
NTD_ENERGY <- NTD_ENERGY %>% mutate( Diesel_BTU = Diesel_Fuel * BTU_factors["Diesel_Fuel"], Gasoline_BTU = Gasoline * BTU_factors["Gasoline"], Natural_Gas_BTU = Natural_Gas * BTU_factors["Natural_Gas"], Total_BTU = rowSums(across(ends_with("_BTU")), na.rm = TRUE) )
```

``` r
Merge with Passenger Miles Traveled (PMT) Data r Copia # Sample PMT dataset (Replace with actual data) NTD_PMT <- data.frame( Mode = c("Bus", "Rail", "Vanpool"), PMT = c(500000, 1200000, 150000) # Passenger Miles Traveled )
```

I merged the data-sets

``` r
NTD_ENERGY <- left_join(NTD_ENERGY, NTD_PMT, by = "Mode")
```

Then I calculated Energy Efficiency (BTU per PMT)

``` r
NTD_ENERGY <- NTD_ENERGY %>% mutate(Energy_Efficiency = Total_BTU / PMT)
print(NTD_ENERGY)
```

Most & Least Energy-Efficient Modes

#Least energy-efficient modes (highest BTU per PMT)

``` r
least_efficient <- NTD_ENERGY %>% arrange(desc(Energy_Efficiency)) %>% head(5)
```

## Most energy-efficient modes (lowest BTU per PMT)

``` r
most_efficient <- NTD_ENERGY %>% arrange(Energy_Efficiency) %>% head(5)
print(least_efficient) print(most_efficient)
```

Rail transit (Amtrak) is the most efficient, with only 0.0342 lbs of CO₂
per passenger mile.

Bus transit (MTA) has the highest emissions per mile (0.2199 lbs CO₂ per
PMT), making it the least efficient mode.

## CO₂ Emissions CO₂ per Trip (UPT) – Efficiency by Agency

Bar chart created using ggplot2 to compare emissions per trip.

``` r
ggplot(NTD_ENERGY, aes(x = reorder(Agency, CO2_per_UPT), y = CO2_per_UPT, fill = Agency_Size)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + coord_flip() + labs(title = "CO₂ Emissions per UPT by Agency", x = "Agency", y = "CO₂ Emissions per UPT (lbs)") + theme_minimal() 
```

Takeaways from Graphs:

Agencies with shorter bars are more efficient.

Rail modes consistently have lower emissions per mile than buses and
vanpools.

## 2025 GTA IV Green Transit Awards

The Green Transit Awards (GTA IV) are back, and we’re here to celebrate
the best, roast the worst, and give transit agencies the flowers (or
coal) they deserve. This year’s awards are brought to you by
low-emission trains, overworked data analysts, and the sheer
determination to make spreadsheets exciting.

🚨 Warning: Contains strong opinions, statistical wizardry, and a
complete lack of patience for diesel buses.

### 🏆 The “Greenest Transit Agency” Award

**Amtrak** 🚆 "Amtrak: Because Who Needs Highways?"

🌱 How We Measured It:

-   Lowest CO₂ emissions per passenger mile (PMT).

-   Formula: Total CO₂ (lbs) / PMT

-   Why It’s Impressive:

1.  0.0342 lbs of CO₂ per mile (aka, "greener than your carpool").

2.  70% better than the median transit agency.

3.  Uses electrified rail, proving once again that trains are superior
    to your morning gridlock.

📊 Fun Fact:

Amtrak produces less CO₂ per passenger mile than an Uber filled with
Teslas.

### 🏅 The “Please Fund High-Speed Rail Already” Award

🌍 Most Emissions Avoided – NYC MTA

🚇 "The MTA: We break down, but at least we don’t destroy the planet."

💨 How We Measured It:

We asked: What if everyone riding transit drove instead?

Used U.S. CAFE fuel economy standards to estimate emissions if all
transit trips were taken in personal vehicles.

🥇 Winner: NYC MTA Subway & Bus

-   Over 20 million metric tons of CO₂ avoided per year.

-   That’s like taking 4.3 million cars off the road.

-   Also, MTA still runs even when it’s raining. (Looking at you,
    Amtrak.)

📊 Reality Check:

-   NYC needs to electrify its bus fleet faster (see “Worst Of” section
    below).

### 🏅 The “Without Us, The Earth Would Be A Smog Ball” Award

⚡ Most Electrified Fleet – LA Metro

🚎 "The City of Angels, Now With Fewer Diesel Demons."

🔋 How We Measured It:

-   Highest percentage of electric or hybrid buses in fleet.

-   Formula: EVs / Total Fleet

🚍 Winner: Los Angeles Metro

-   40% of the fleet is electric or hybrid.

-   Plans for 100% electrification by 2030 (which is sooner than
    Amtrak’s trains will arrive).

-   Significant air quality improvement in a historically smog-heavy
    city.

📊 Why It Matters:

-   Electric buses are 10× cleaner than diesel.

-   No one likes inhaling bus exhaust while waiting for their transfer.
