## üé¨ Introduction

In a data-driven age, studios increasingly seek reliable strategies to forecast a film‚Äôs financial success. This project explores the question:

> _"How do film budgets influence box office outcomes, and how does risk scale with investment size?"_

I was responsible for **Finding 1: Budget vs. Box Office**, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. This section establishes whether budgets predict performance and how to quantify return on investment (ROI) in the movie industry.

---

## üì• Data Acquisition & Preparation

Two sources formed the backbone of this analysis:

- **IMDb**: Provided metadata like title, release year, and genre.
- **The Numbers**: Supplied production budget and domestic box office gross.

R:
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

# Load and clean the dataset
data <- read_csv("data/budget_box_office.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  filter(!is.na(production_budget), !is.na(domestic_gross)) %>%
  mutate(
    production_budget = parse_number(production_budget),
    domestic_gross = parse_number(domestic_gross),
    roi = domestic_gross / production_budget
  )

Final cleaned dataset: ~5,000 films with numeric budget and gross values.

## üìà Linear Regression: Budget vs. Gross

To quantify the budget-gross relationship, I fit a linear regression model:

R:
model <- lm(domestic_gross ~ production_budget, data = data)
summary(model)


### üìä Model Output

- **F-statistic:** 6593
- **p-value:** < 0.001
- **R¬≤:** ~0.37

This confirms a strong statistical relationship. However, variability increases with budget.

### üìâ Visualization

R:
ggplot(data, aes(x = production_budget, y = domestic_gross)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "darkblue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(
    title = "Production Budget vs. Domestic Gross",
    x = "Production Budget (log scale)",
    y = "Domestic Gross (log scale)"
  )


The scatterplot shows clear positive correlation but substantial spread‚Äîespecially at high budget levels.

## üí° ROI by Budget Tier

To explore efficiency, I segmented ROI by production budget tiers:

R:
data <- data %>%
  mutate(budget_group = case_when(
    production_budget < 30e6 ~ "Low-to-Mid Budget",
    between(production_budget, 30e6, 100e6) ~ "Mid-to-High Budget",
    production_budget > 100e6 ~ "Blockbuster"
  ))

roi_summary <- data %>%
  group_by(budget_group) %>%
  summarise(avg_roi = mean(roi, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

roi_summary


### üìã ROI Table

| Budget Group        | Avg ROI |
|---------------------|----------|
| Low-to-Mid Budget   | 2.5      |
| Mid-to-High Budget  | 1.4      |
| Blockbuster         | 1.1      |

### üìä Boxplot by Budget Tier

R:
ggplot(data, aes(x = budget_group, y = roi)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1)) +
  labs(
    title = "ROI Distribution by Budget Tier",
    x = "Budget Group",
    y = "Return on Investment (ROI)"
  )


Lower-budget films often yield higher ROI. Blockbusters, though profitable, show diminishing marginal returns.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Marketing expenses were excluded.
- Revenue was limited to domestic box office (not global).
- Genre classifications are inconsistent.
- Streaming impact not included.

---

## üîÆ Future Work

- Incorporate international revenue and marketing spend.
- Use non-linear models (e.g., random forest).
- Analyze by genre and rating.
- Include critic/audience reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.
