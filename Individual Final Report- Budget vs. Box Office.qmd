## üé¨ Introduction

In a data-driven age, studios increasingly seek reliable strategies to forecast a film‚Äôs financial success. This project explores the question:

> *"How do film budgets influence box office outcomes, and how does risk scale with investment size?"*

I was responsible for **Finding 1: Budget vs. Box Office**, including data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization. This section establishes whether budgets predict performance and how to quantify return on investment (ROI) in the movie industry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üì• Data Acquisition & Preparation

Two sources formed the backbone of this analysis:

-   **IMDb**: Provided metadata like title, release year, and genre.
-   **The Numbers**: Supplied production budget and domestic box office gross.

R: library(tidyverse) library(janitor)

# Load and clean the dataset

The foundation of this analysis relied on a dataset that combines financial and descriptive data about a wide range of films. Specifically, I focused on information such as production budgets and domestic box office gross, which are critical inputs for understanding a film‚Äôs commercial performance.

I used a `.csv` file sourced from **The Numbers**, a reliable industry database that tracks movie revenues. Before performing any analysis, it was essential to clean and prepare this dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency.

The cleaning process involved several steps:

**Standardizing column names** to simplify analysis and avoid inconsistencies in naming conventions.

**Removing rows with missing values** in critical columns like `production_budget` and `domestic_gross`. These fields are required to compute meaningful financial comparisons and ROI calculations.

**Parsing numeric values** from text-formatted currency fields. Many entries included dollar signs and commas (e.g., `$100,000,000`), which had to be converted into usable numeric values.

**Creating a new metric, ROI (Return on Investment)**, by dividing a film‚Äôs gross revenue by its production budget. This derived variable helps assess efficiency, not just scale.

After these steps, we were left with a clean and structured dataset of approximately **5,000 films**. These records span a wide range of budget levels and genres, from indie projects to blockbuster franchises. This cleaned dataset enabled a focused and reliable investigation into how budgetary choices relate to box office outcomes‚Äîlaying the groundwork for our statistical models and visual analysis.

R: data \<- read_csv("data/budget_box_office.csv") %\>% clean_names() %\>% filter(!is.na(production_budget), !is.na(domestic_gross)) %\>% mutate( production_budget = parse_number(production_budget), domestic_gross = parse_number(domestic_gross), roi = domestic_gross / production_budget )

Final cleaned dataset: \~5,000 films with numeric budget and gross values.

## üìà Linear Regression: Budget vs. Gross

To quantify the budget-gross relationship, I fit a linear regression model:

R: model \<- lm(domestic_gross \~ production_budget, data = data) summary(model)

### üìä Model Output

-   **F-statistic:** 6593
-   **p-value:** \< 0.001
-   **R¬≤:** \~0.37

This confirms a strong statistical relationship. However, variability increases with budget.

### üìâ Visualization

R: ggplot(data, aes(x = production_budget, y = domestic_gross)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "darkblue") + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") + scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) + labs( title = "Production Budget vs. Domestic Gross", x = "Production Budget (log scale)", y = "Domestic Gross (log scale)" )

The scatterplot shows clear positive correlation but substantial spread‚Äîespecially at high budget levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üí° ROI by Budget Tier

To explore efficiency, I segmented ROI by production budget tiers:

R: data \<- data %\>% mutate(budget_group = case_when( production_budget \< 30e6 \~ "Low-to-Mid Budget", between(production_budget, 30e6, 100e6) \~ "Mid-to-High Budget", production_budget \> 100e6 \~ "Blockbuster" ))

roi_summary \<- data %\>% group_by(budget_group) %\>% summarise(avg_roi = mean(roi, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')

roi_summary

### üìã ROI Table

| Budget Group       | Avg ROI |
|--------------------|---------|
| Low-to-Mid Budget  | 2.5     |
| Mid-to-High Budget | 1.4     |
| Blockbuster        | 1.1     |

### üìä Boxplot by Budget Tier

R: ggplot(data, aes(x = budget_group, y = roi)) + geom_boxplot(fill = "skyblue") + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format(accuracy = 0.1)) + labs( title = "ROI Distribution by Budget Tier", x = "Budget Group", y = "Return on Investment (ROI)" )

Lower-budget films often yield higher ROI. Blockbusters, though profitable, show diminishing marginal returns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

-   Marketing expenses were excluded.
-   Revenue was limited to domestic box office (not global).
-   Genre classifications are inconsistent.
-   Streaming impact not included.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîÆ Future Work

-   Incorporate international revenue and marketing spend.
-   Use non-linear models (e.g., random forest).
-   Analyze by genre and rating.
-   Include critic/audience reviews from Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic.
